To: OGC members & interested parties

A re-charter and re-naming of a OGC Standards Working Group is being proposed.
The OGC members listed below have proposed to rename
the "Observations and Measurements v2 Standards Working Group" to the
"Observations and measurements Standards Working Group" (O&M SWG), and
revise the SWG Charter to reflect the modified scope of the work.
The SWG proposal provided in this document meets the requirements of the OGC TC Policies and Procedures.

The SWG name, statement of purpose, scope, list of deliverables, audience, and language specified in the proposal will constitute the SWG's official charter. Technical discussions may occur no sooner than the SWG's first meeting.

This SWG will operate under the OGC IPR Policy. The eligibility requirements for becoming a participant in the SWG at the first meeting (see details below) are that:

* You must be an employee of an OGC member organization or an individual
member of OGC;
* The OGC member must have signed the OGC Membership agreement;
* You must notify the SWG chair of your intent to participate to the first meeting. Members may do so by logging onto the OGC Portal and navigating to the Observer page and clicking on the link for the SWG they wish to join and;
* You must attend meetings of the SWG. The first meeting of this SWG is at the time and date fixed below. Attendance may be by teleconference.

Of course, participants also may join the SWG at any time. The OGC and the SWG welcomes all interested parties.

Non-OGC members who wish to participate may contact us about joining the OGC. In addition, the public may access some of the resources maintained for each SWG: the SWG public description, the SWG Charter, Change Requests, and public comments, which will be linked from the SWG’s page.

Please feel free to forward this announcement to any other appropriate lists. The OGC is an open standards organization; we encourage your feedback.

== Purpose of the Standards Working Group
The O&M standard was originally conceived within the OGC Sensor Web Enablement Initiative in 2003-2007 and
version 2.0 was co-published as the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20 and ISO 19156:2011.
The latest version of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20 is from 2013, and among other things, it
requires revising to accommodate technical issues discovered in various standard implementations and
harmonization with recent W3C/OGC standardization work on sensor network terminology and concepts defined
in the Semantic Sensor Network (SSN) and Sensor, Observation, Sample, and Actuator (SOSA) ontologies.

The revision work of OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20/ISO 19156 was agreed by both OGC and ISO/TC 211 in July 2018. This work will be carried out
within ISO/TC 211 with support from the O&M SWG to ensure that:

* the concerns and requirements identified by OCG and ISO members are attended to;
* the final document is suitable as an OGC Standard as well as an ISO Standard; and
* the revised version of the ISO 19156 Standard gets published as a revised OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20 document.

In addition to supporting the ISO 19156 revision work of ISO/TC 211, the purpose of the OGC Observations and measurements
SWG is to revise existing and draft new OGC Standards considering the encoding of the O&M conceptual models.

This Standards Working Group evaluates and resolves submitted Change Request Proposals (CRPs)
considering the OGC O&M Implementation Standards and drafts new OGC Candidate Standards considering
encoding of spatial data following the O&M conceptual models.

The SWG SHALL ensure that all changes are consistent with the OGC standards baseline and business plan.

== Business Value Proposition
Standards based exchange of observed, measured or modeled data are key enablers for many critical online consumer
and governmental services. Examples of these data sets include weather, air quality and other kinds of environmental
observations and forecasts, traffic monitoring data, health monitoring, building and construction safety measurements,
various remote sensing data, and industrial process monitoring. The Observations and measurements Standard
(OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20/ISO 19156:2011, O&M) defines a conceptual level data model for these datasets.

The OGC Observations and Measurements - XML Implementation (OGC 10-025r1) Standard defines an XML encoding for the
concepts defined in OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20 and thus needs to be revised to accommodate the changes made in the
revised OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20.

In addition to the revision of the O&M XML Implementation Standard, there is an identified need
to standardize an O&M data encoding for the formats like JSON/GeoJSON preferred in modern Web APIs including the
ones conforming to the OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core Standard (OGC 17-069).

Both the Observations and Measurements conceptual data model and its
standardized XML encoding (OGC 10-025r1) are used extensively in Spatial Data Infrastructures such as in the EU INSPIRE.
There is also an on-going work for providing INSPIRE O&M data sets also in JSON/GeoJSON based formats, but no standard
has yet been identified describing an interoperable way of doing this.


== Scope of Work
The Scope of Work of the O&M SWG is described as follows.

* Review changes proposed to the standard and cooperate with ISO/TC 211 in a timely manner.
* Collect Change Request Proposals (CRPs) submitted by OGC members, evaluate each of these proposals, and handle of them in a manner which is consistent with OGC processes respecting the liaison arrangement with ISO/TC 211. This shall be achieved by either:
** conferring on the change request content with the relevant group of ISO/TC 211 for processing if the CRP is found to impact the O&M conceptual model; or
** considering the change request within the SWG if the CRP impacts an extension, encoding, or profile of the core O&M concepts.
* Define and document new OGC candidate standards for encoding O&M concepts defined in the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20 applicable for use cases which not supported well by the existing encoding standards.

For the revised OGC Standards, the SWG will make edits to the standard documents based on CRPs and related decisions of the SWG membership.
The SWG, at their discretion, may also ask the membership for any additional change requests that have not been previous
submitted.

The final deliverables of the SWG SHALL be revisions of an existing OGC Standards and new Candidate OGC Standards for
consideration by the membership for adoption.

=== Statement of relationship of planned work to the current OGC standards baseline

As regards to the revision of the OGC Observations and Measurements - XML Implementation (OGC 10-025r1) Standard,
both the changes in the O&M conceptual model defined in the revised OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20 and any OGC CRPs
targeting 10-025r1 and submitted before the cut-off date of 30 September 2019 will be considered. The Sensor Observation
Service Interface Standard (SOS) directly refers to the OGC 10-025r1 and its
XML Schemas. Revising the SOS standard is out-of-scope of the O&M SWG, but the O&M SWG will keep the SWE Umbrella SWG
updated on the changes proposed for the O&M XML Implementation Standard.

Other encodings of the O&M concepts have been discussed in OGC Observations and Measurements – JSON
implementation Discussion Paper (15-100r1) and informally in the OGC Observations and Measurements -
Simple Feature model & encodings project (OMSF).
OGC SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing (15-078r6) also includes an JSON encodings for O&M concepts defined in the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20
conceptual model. These and any other documents considered relevant by the SWG membership
will be used as inputs for drafting the OGC candidate standard O&M JSON encoding.

=== What is Out of Scope?

The scope of the O&M SWG is in data models and encodings. Thus activities aiming at standardization of
data access patterns or services is out of scope. In the cases where programmatic access and management
O&M data requires or would benefit from special treatment within the context of a particular OGC APIs or other
access methods, the O&M SWG SHALL raise these issues in discussions with the SWGs responsible for these
APIs or other access methods.

The OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20 / ISO 19156 Standard is normatively referred to in several OGC Standards and other documents, including,
but not limited to the following:

* Sensor Observation Service Interface Standard (12-006);
* SensorThings API Part 1: Sensing (15-078r6);
* SensorThings API Part 2: Tasking Core (17-079r1);
* Timeseries Profile of Observations and Measurements (15-043r3);
* OGC Abstract Specification Topic 21: Discrete Global Grid Systems Abstract Specification (15-104r5);
* OGC® WaterML 2.0: Part 1 - TimeseriesWaterML (10-126r4);
* OGC® WaterML 2.0: Part 2 - Ratings, Gaugings and Sections (15-018r2);
* OGC® WaterML 2: Part 3 - Surface Hydrology Features (HY_Features) - Conceptual Model (14-111r6);
* OGC WaterML 2: Part 4 – GroundWaterML 2 (GWML2) (16-032r2); and
* OGC® Geoscience Markup Language 4.1 (GeoSciML) (16-008).

The O&M SWG will summarize the changes made in the revised OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20 and make this information available to
the OGC TC and/or SWGs responsible for maintaining these Standards. However, suggesting or making revisions to
the existing OGC Standards normatively referring to the OGC Abstract Specification Topic 20,
apart OGC Observations and Measurements - XML Implementation (10-025r1), is out-of-scope of the O&M SWG.

The O&M SWG may not consider Change Request Proposals submitted for the the Abstract Specification Topic 20 (10-004r3)
or OGC Observations and Measurements - XML Implementation (10-025r1) after the cut-off date of 30 September 2019. Any
CRPs submitted after the cut-off date will be regarded as future work unless the O&M SWG explicitly decides to address
then as part of the revision work outlined in the <<Initial Deliverables>>.
